# Command & Control server

This is a c&c -server for Lora cluster, hosted under the main server. Although, server might be a misleading name for this tool since it does not really serve anything. It is more like an interface to allow testing and administration of other hosted servers. Must be started with the main server's main.php with cac as its first argument.
